# Tic tac toe 

I created this game as a way to test my understanding of what
I learned from the reactjs website

It has the following
- Let's you play tic-tac-toe
- Indicates when a player has won the game
- Stores a game's history as the game progresses
- Allows players to review a game's history and see previous versions of a game's board.
